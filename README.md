# i3 status
A python script that generates json data for the i3 window manager status bar.

# Statuses:
- `Spotify` (song playing + time played. accurate-ish)
- `Date`
- `Runescape` AFK timer
- `VM` mouse status (?) (i think it just checks if the mouse is passed through to some VM, very situational)
- `Headphone battery` (not used since it disconnects the headphones lol)
